# Summary:
In this code, we have a Python program that allows the user to select a file and then generates a summary of their learnings from the selected file. The program uses the OpenHermes AI model to generate the summary. It also creates a README file with the summary titled "{base_name}_Learnings_README.md".

# Learnings:
- How to create a GUI using Tkinter in Python for user interaction (file selection)
- How to send HTTP POST requests and receive responses using the Requests library
- How to parse JSON data from API responses
- How to use the OpenHermes AI model for generating summaries from text inputs
- How to write a generated summary into a separate file

# Conclusion:
This code allowed me to practice working with Tkinter, Requests, and parsing JSON data. It also gave me hands-on experience using an AI model (OpenHermes) for generating summaries from text inputs. The process of writing the generated summary into a separate file helped me understand how to work with files in Python. Overall, this code was a valuable learning experience that improved my coding skillset.
